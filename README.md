## A

- **algorithm**: the basic technique used to get the job done.
- **application (software)**:a program or group of programs designed for end users.s
- **API (application programming interface)**: an intermediary software that allows two or more applications to talk to each other.
- **array**: a data structure consisting of a collection of elements ,values or variables each identified by at least one array index or key. _see [list](#L)_
- **/attribute**: information about elements of a component in your website design/build.

## B

- **branch**: a parallel world where you can create commit without introducing bugs into production code.
- **boolean**: a data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true and false).
- **/bug**: an error or flaw in the website or app that keeps it from running as expected.

## C

- **cache**: The storage of certain elements to help with faster load times from repeat website visitors./////
- **callback**: a function that is passed as an argument to another and is expected to execute at a given time.
- **class**: a defined structure to create an object in an object-oriented programming language.
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: the terminal version of an application.
- **compiler**: a program that translates computer code written in one programming language into another language.
- **components**: independent and reusable bits of code that work in isolation and returns HTML via a render function. _see [web components](#W)_
- **control flow**: the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed.
- **/cookies**: This is the data sent by an Internet server to a browser. Each time the browser accesses the same server, it sends the data back as a means of tracking how (and how often) it accesses the server.

## D

- **database**: a central location in which data is stored and managed.
- **Data-driven Programming**: A programming paradigm in which the program statements describe the data to be matched and the processing required rather than defining a sequence of steps to be taken.
- **documentation(docs)**: a written text or illustration that accompanies a software which either explains how the software operates or how to use it.

## E

- **ecosystem**: a collection of software projects, which are developed and co-evolve in the same environment.
- **enum**: a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.
- **extension**: a piece of software extends the capabilities of an appliation and adds extra features to an already working standalone application.
- **extension(file)**: a three or four-letter abbreviation that signifies the file type. Eg: `.js .tsx`

## F

- **framework**: a concrete platform where common code with generic functionality can be selectively specialized or overridden by developers or users.
- **float**: a data type composed of a number that is not an integer, because it includes a fraction represented in decimal format.
- **function**: a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.
- **Functional Programming**: A programming paradigm that builds software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.

## I

- **IDE(Integrated Development Environment)**: a software application that combines all of the features and tools needed by a software developer.
- **integer(int)**: a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.

## L

- **library**: a single or collection of files, programs, routines, scripts, or functions that can be referenced in another code.
- **list**: a collection type that stores ordered, non-unique elements which allow duplicates.
- **loop**: a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met.

# M

- **Markup Language**: a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document.

## N

- **null**: a special data type which can have only one value: NULL.

## O

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: A programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

- **operator**: a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result.

## P

- **plugin**: _see [extension](#e)_
- **Procedural Programming**: a programming paradigm based upon the concept of procedure calls, in which statements are structured into procedures (also known as subroutines or functions).
- **Programming**: the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
- **Programming Language**: a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. _Eg. JavaScript, Python._
- **Programming Paradigm**: a style or "way" of programming.

# R

- **repository**: a central location in which code is stored and managed.
- **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services.
- **RESTful Web Services**: web services that conform to the REST architectural style.

## S

- **string**: a sequence of characters.
- **syntax**: The grammer of a programming language.

## T

- **template**: a preformatted file that serve as the starting point for another file.
- **testing**: a process, to evaluate the functionality of a software application with an intent to find whether the developed software met the specified requirements or not and to identify the bugs to ensure that the product is bug-free.
- **testing framework**: a set of guidelines or rules used for creating and designing test cases.
- **type (data type)**: an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

## U

- **UI (User Interface)**: the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device.
- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: the address of a given unique resource on the Web.

## V

- **Version Control**: a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

## W

- **Web Components**: a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.
- **webhooks**: automated messages sent from apps when something happens.
